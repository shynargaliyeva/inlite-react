## About
This project was built as a recommendation engine that filters your movie recs based on a psychological analysis done by lisenced professioanls and a depression score computed from a self-evaluation test. The ultimate goal is to build the worlds first streaming entertainment platform with integrated therapeutic chatbot and make Inlite a safe place for watching movies to help manage mental health.

## Getting Started

Link to **[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/RFm9CDpZ/inlite)**.

Try it out **[here](https://inlite.herokuapp.com/)**!


### Unresolved issues

1. Admin user: add admin user, so that movies can be added to the database by admin/psychologist. (right now 9 movies are seeded).
2. Style: Continue styling to get closer to the wireframes design.


## Next Steps

Trello board will show a long list of Iceboxed features, to name a few:
* Login with social media account.
* Depression meter for each movie. (Like Rotten Tomatoes)
* CBT chatbot.
